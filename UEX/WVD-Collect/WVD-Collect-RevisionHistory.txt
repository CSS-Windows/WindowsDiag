**WVD-Collect Revision History**

Version number / Change Notes

v201110.3:
* Added a new command line parameter "-DiagOnly". 
	When executed with this parameter (even if other parameters are also included) the script will skip ALL data collection and will ONLY run the diagnostics part. 
	This is useful when you want to run only a quick Diag without collecting additional data.
	Important: To run diagnostics also for a specific scenario (like Profile troubleshooting), the corresponding command line parameter needs to be present too.
	E.g.: 
		"WVD-Collect -DiagOnly" will run only the default diagnostics
		"WVD-Collect -Profile -DiagOnly" will run the default diagnostics + "Profile"-specific diagnostics
* The script will now also collect:
	* "fltmc filters" output in the "\*_Fltmc.txt" file
	* the most recent C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\MonitoringAgent.log file
	* WVDAgent and WVDAgentManager registry keys and log files when ran on Windows 7 hosts
* When executed using the "-Profile" parameter:
	* the FSLogix specific logs (if present) will now be stored directly under the \*_FSLogix subfolder, instead of \*_LogFiles\FSLogix
	* the script will also collect:
		* "frx list-redirects" and "frx list-rules" output (if FSLogix is present) in the "\*_FSLogix\*_Frx-list.txt" file
		* Windows Defender Exclusions registry keys for Extensions, Paths and Processes under the \*_RegistryKeys folder
* Merged output of "Get-DscConfiguration" and "Get-DscConfigurationStatus" into one file *_Get-DscConfiguration.txt
* Fixed an issue that was preventing the Geneva Scheduled Task information to be collected from Windows 10/Server 2012R2+ machines.
* Fixed some errors when running the script on Windows 7 hosts and newer PowerShell cmdlets were not available.
* [WVD-Diag] Improved detection of the active WVD listener, especially when there are multiple listener registry keys present. 
* [WVD-Diag] Added check for the value of the "SessionDirectoryListener" registry key which contains information on the WVD listener currently in use.
* [WVD-Diag] Added check for "SSL Cipher Suite Order" configuration
* [WVD-Diag] Added StartType information to the checked services
* [WVD-Diag] Added status check for the "RdAgent" and "WinRM" services
* [WVD-Diag] Added status check for the "WVDAgent" and "WVDAgentManager" services when the script is executed on Windows 7 hosts
* [WVD-Diag] When executed using the "-Profile" parameter, the script will also check the status of the "frxsvc", "frxdrv", "frxccds", "OneDrive Updater Service" services
* Minor code and layout improvements


v201028.3:
* The script is now digitally signed with a Microsoft Code Signing certificate.
* Moved PSVersion collection from PSVersion.txt to SystemInfo.txt. 
	The PSVersion.txt will no longer be generated.
* Once data collection is complete, a File Explorer window will open pointing to the location containing the collected data
* [WVD-Diag] Added check if the RDSH role is installed on server OS hosts and log the result in WVD-Diag. 
	If the role is missing on server OS VMs, then installing the agent and registering the host in the host pool may fail.
* Updated WVD-Diag.txt layout
* Minor code fixes


v200912.0:
* Improved WVD Diagnostics functionality. The script will now also check and generate a report (WVD-Diag.txt) with:

	* 'DeleteUserAppContainersOnLogoff' registry key (FW rules bloating scenario)

* Hotfixes are now listed in descending order, with the most recently installed hotfix on top (Hotfixes.txt)
* Minor code fixes


v200722.2:
* Added command line parameter "-Teams" to collect Teams specific data for troubleshooting Teams WVD optimization issues (requires the script to run under the affected user's WVD session + the user to have pressed Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1 before running the script, to have generated the Teams diagnostics logs).
* Added additional confirmation prompt when launching the script with the "-Teams" parameter to get the user's confirmation that the prerequisites have been met before continuing
* When running the script with the "-Teams" parameter, besides the default WVD data, the following data will are also collected:
	* Teams logs file: %appdata%\Microsoft\Teams\logs.txt
	* Teams diagnostics log files (only availaible if the user has used the key combination Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1 in Teams before, to generate them):

		* %userprofile%\Downloads\MSTeams Diagnostics Log DATE_TIME_calling.txt
		* %userprofile%\Downloads\MSTeams Diagnostics Log DATE_TIME_cdl.txt
